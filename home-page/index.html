                <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="A pics of me prosper bright">
                <p>My name is Prosper Bright, and I'm a passionate learner with a growing interest in technology, web development, and digital creativity. I currently reside in Lagos, Nigeria a vibrant, energetic city that constantly inspires me with its diversity, resilience, and culture. I enjoy exploring how things work, especially in programming, and I'm currently sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, and C#. Beyond the screen, I value family, faith, and community. I'm also part of the BYU-Pathway program, where I'm learning not just academics but life principles that shape my personal and professional growth. Whether it's solving problems through code or making a difference in small ways, I believe in learning, evolving, and staying purpose driven.</p>
